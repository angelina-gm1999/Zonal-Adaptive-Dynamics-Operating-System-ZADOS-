Development log: Neurochemical Control Layer specification consolidation

Date: 11 January 2026

Work this session focused on consolidating and preparing the neurochemical control layer specification in its abstracted form. The layer is defined as an internal modulation system for cognitive dynamics, reward weighting, memory salience, and stochastic variability. Neurotransmitters are explicitly treated as synthetic control variables, not biological simulations and not expressive emotional states. All neurochemical variables are bounded, clamped within predefined limits, and logged for auditability. 

The modeled neurochemical signals were specified as a consistent set of abstracted analogues and their functional roles were enumerated: dopamine (exploration, novelty sensitivity, reward amplification, policy switching pressure), serotonin (inhibitory control, stability, harm avoidance, confidence dampening), norepinephrine (alertness, urgency, threat sensitivity, precision–noise tradeoff), acetylcholine (attention focus, learning-rate adjustment, signal-to-noise optimization), oxytocin (relational salience and trust weighting), endocannabinoid-like signals (stress buffering, saturation control, cooldown/disengagement dynamics), and intermittent stress/cortisol analogues for overload and fatigue/threat escalation contexts. 

The dynamic evolution of neurochemical states was specified using stochastic differential equations with deterministic drift and bounded stochastic perturbations, including decay/reuptake, fatigue accumulation, tolerance/sensitization effects, and controlled noise injection. Numerical integration was specified using Euler–Maruyama. A dopamine-specific SDE example was detailed, including explicit release drivers (baseline + novelty term + reward prediction error term), reuptake with fatigue/downregulation modulation, diffusion/spillover, enzymatic degradation, and square-root noise scaling, along with representative parameter ranges and discrete-time Euler–Maruyama update equations. 

Receptor systems were organized as explicit subtype families, including dopaminergic (D1–D5), serotonergic (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4–7 placeholder grouping), noradrenergic (α1, α2A, α3, β1, β2), cholinergic (α7 nicotinic and muscarinic M1–M5), glutamatergic (NMDA, AMPA, Kainate, mGluR1–8), GABAergic (GABA-A, GABA-B), plus OXTR, opioid receptors (μ/κ/δ), CB1, and cortisol receptor GR/NR3C1. Receptor attributes were specified to include density, sensitivity, state (active/desensitized/internalized), and synaptic location (pre/post/extrasynaptic). Binding dynamics were represented using Hill-type occupancy, and slower pharmacodynamic adaptation mechanisms were enumerated (desensitization, internalization, upregulation/sensitization, tolerance via sensitivity decay, and subtype switching). 

Oscillatory modulation was specified as a secondary modulation layer, including delta/theta/alpha/beta/gamma band analogues, with support for cross-frequency coupling (theta–gamma and alpha–beta). Oscillations were defined to modulate kinetic parameters (release gain, reuptake, noise scaling) and receptor transition rates (activation/desensitization/recycling), with example formulations and an oscillatory modulation framework that remains agnostic to oscillation source (internal sinusoidal envelopes or external normalized envelopes). Time-scale separation was explicitly stated: fast dynamics for neurochemical fluctuations and oscillatory modulation, slow dynamics for archetypal states, learning processes, and long-term reward drift, with hysteresis mechanisms to prevent rapid state oscillation. 

An evaluation-to-neurochemical mapping specification was included as a feedforward translation layer: an evaluation vector e(t) composed of normalized dimensions (examples listed: novelty, valence, intensity, urgency, logical conflict, coherence, familiarity, social salience), mapped to neurochemical release potentials via a linear matrix M, with optional thresholded nonlinear activation (bias terms and bounded activation). Tonic vs phasic decomposition of release drive was specified, along with fatigue/tolerance and oscillatory envelopes as constraints on effective release drive passed into the kinetic layer. The mapping layer explicitly performs no temporal integration, introduces no plasticity, and does not alter receptor state. 

A modular system integration framework was organized by anatomical modules (PFC/ACC, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, ventral striatum, cerebellum, insula), each described using a standardized template including neurochemical substrates (with receptor subtypes), oscillatory profile, pharmacodynamic characteristics, reward relevance, and cross-domain feedback dependencies. An isolated neurochemical-by-module summary was also included, along with crossmaps (neurotransmitter→receptor families), brainwave–neurochemical coupling notes, and derived internal metrics examples (motivation, empathy, cognitive rigidity, fatigue) expressed as combinations of neurochemical/receptor and oscillatory terms. 

At the end of this session, the neurochemical layer documentation existed as a consolidated specification containing: (1) the abstracted neurochemical variable set and bounded representation rules, (2) SDE-based kinetic formulations with an explicit dopamine example and Euler–Maruyama updates, (3) receptor families and pharmacodynamic adaptation mechanisms, (4) oscillatory modulation and cross-frequency coupling formulations, (5) a feedforward evaluation-to-neurochemical mapping layer, and (6) a brain-region integration template tying neurochemistry, receptors, oscillations, and pharmacodynamics into consistent module profiles.
