Development log: initial build session
Date: 11 December, 2025

Initialized the ZA-DOS project environment and established a stable, src-based Python package structure using an editable installation and a reproducible pytest workflow. Resolved environment conflicts between conda and venv tooling and fixed the development configuration to a single, deterministic setup. Implemented the core reward infrastructure, including typed base interfaces for reward domains and subdomains, shared dataclasses for scoring, thresholds, structured flags, and provenance metadata, and a minimal RewardContext abstraction. All primitives are covered by unit tests and currently stable.

Implemented the Logic and Coherence reward domain as the first concrete domain. Introduced epistemic regulation submodules covering confidence calibration, uncertainty acknowledgment, and abstention appropriateness. These evaluators operate exclusively on internal state signals and are explicitly decoupled from memory storage and generation mechanisms. Defined formal placeholder interfaces for MemoryContrastPort and CognitiveTracePort to enforce a strict separation between evaluation logic and the underlying memory or reasoning engines.

Using the memory contrast interface, implemented a full set of longitudinal coherence evaluators: internal consistency, external consistency, semantic continuity, concept continuity, context fidelity, and concept fidelity. Each evaluator derives coherence signals through contrast-based inputs rather than direct memory access, produces normalized scores with structured risk flags, and degrades gracefully when required ports are unavailable. The LogicDomain aggregation layer was updated to support optional port injection, surface dependency availability through metadata, and deterministically combine submodule outputs.

All implemented components are fully unit-tested and passing. At this stage, the reward system core and the Logic and Coherence domain through memory-contrast–based evaluation are complete. The next planned work is the addition of engine-trace–based logic evaluators, including logical structure analysis, scientific rigor assessment, and Socratic reasoning scoring, built on top of the CognitiveTracePort abstraction.
