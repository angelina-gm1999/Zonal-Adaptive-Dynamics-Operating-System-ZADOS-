Development log: initial build session
Date: 11 December, 2025

Initialized the ZA-DOS project environment and established a stable Python development setup with a reproducible testing workflow. Environment conflicts were resolved and the configuration was consolidated into a single, deterministic development baseline. Core reward-system scaffolding was implemented, including shared abstractions for scoring, thresholds, structured evaluation signals, and provenance tracking. All foundational components are covered by unit tests and currently stable.

A first evaluative domain focused on logical coherence was implemented to validate internal epistemic properties of system outputs. This domain introduces regulation mechanisms for confidence handling, uncertainty signaling, and appropriate non-response behavior. These mechanisms operate exclusively on internal evaluation signals and are intentionally isolated from memory storage, content generation, and execution pathways. Formal boundaries were defined to preserve strict separation between evaluative logic and other system subsystems.

Longitudinal coherence assessment capabilities were added using indirect comparison signals rather than direct access to stored representations. These evaluators assess consistency and continuity properties across internal state transitions, emit normalized evaluation outputs with structured risk indicators, and degrade predictably when required signals are unavailable. Domain-level aggregation was updated to support optional dependency injection, surface evaluator availability through metadata, and combine sub-evaluations deterministically.

All implemented components are fully unit-tested and passing. At this stage, the reward-system core and the initial coherence-focused evaluation domain are complete. Planned next work extends evaluative coverage using execution-trace–derived signals to assess higher-order reasoning properties, within the same separation and containment constraints.
All implemented components are fully unit-tested and passing. At this stage, the reward system core and the Logic and Coherence domain through memory-contrast–based evaluation are complete. The next planned work is the addition of engine-trace–based logic evaluators, including logical structure analysis, scientific rigor assessment, and Socratic reasoning scoring, built on top of the CognitiveTracePort abstraction.
