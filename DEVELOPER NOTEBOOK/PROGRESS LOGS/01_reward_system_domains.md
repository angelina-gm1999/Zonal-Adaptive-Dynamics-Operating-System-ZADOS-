Development log: Phase 1 domain expansion and stabilization

Date: Christmas Season, December 2025

Phase 1 of the reward-system evaluation layer was completed, extending coverage beyond logical coherence into ethical alignment, innovation readiness, and human attunement. All work in this phase adheres strictly to a pure-evaluation constraint: domains emit normalized scalar evaluations and structured risk signals without performing synthesis, generation, or side effects. Domain interfaces remain deterministic, inspectable, and fully decoupled from execution and memory subsystems.

An Ethics evaluation domain was implemented to assess alignment with ethical constraints and downstream consequences. Independent evaluators were introduced to reason over fairness, intent clarity, autonomy respect, temporal tradeoffs, human cognitive alignment, feasibility across time horizons, downstream risk amplification, and failure-mode awareness. Each evaluator operates over structured state signals, produces bounded scores with explicit flags, and degrades predictably when required inputs are absent. Domain aggregation was designed to surface evaluator availability and risk conditions transparently without embedding policy logic into execution pathways.

An Innovation evaluation domain was implemented to assess exploratory readiness and controlled divergence rather than creative output quality. Submodules evaluate novelty signals across conceptual, structural, and symbolic dimensions, pattern divergence, exploration drive, challenge complexity, resolution satisfaction, and controlled stochasticity readiness. This domain explicitly avoids injecting randomness or exploration pressure, instead reporting engagement and risk conditions that can be consumed by downstream synthesis layers. All evaluators are model-agnostic and rely solely on internal state descriptors.

A Human Attunement evaluation domain was implemented to assess interpersonal alignment and safety without optimizing persuasion or influence. Submodules evaluate empathetic inference, adaptive response framing, intention calibration, truthfulness tradeoffs, cognitive reading, short- versus long-term interpersonal benefit, attuned dissonance, containment success, benefit delivery success, and persuasion risk suppression. Particular care was taken to separate benefit assessment from influence pressure, and to explicitly flag unconsented or high-risk persuasive dynamics rather than rewarding them. The resulting signals are suitable for safety gating and audit without encoding behavioral objectives.

Across all domains, evaluators were implemented as independent units with zero side effects, consistent naming, and explicit metadata emission. Domain aggregation logic was updated to combine sub-evaluations deterministically while preserving flag provenance and evaluator visibility. All implemented components are covered by unit tests and currently passing.

At this stage, the reward system core and all Phase 1 evaluation domains are complete. Planned next work moves into synthesis and orchestration layers, where these evaluative signals will be composed into response-shaping directives under strict containment and mode-dependent constraints.
