Development log: Phase 7–9 reward profiles, safety scaffolding, and evaluation instrumentation

Date: 11 January 2026

During this phase, the reward and governance substrate of the system was extended with mode-aware configuration, safety dominance scaffolding, and post-hoc evaluation instrumentation. All work in this stage deliberately avoided coupling to generation, learning dynamics, or neurochemical simulation. Components introduced here operate strictly as configuration objects, enforcement interfaces, or metric collectors, and are designed to be auditable, deterministic, and externally inspectable.

A static reward profile layer was implemented to formalize mode awareness without introducing implicit state or adaptive behavior. Five fixed profiles were defined—reflective, exploratory sandbox, ethics training, creative sandbox, and analysis/investigation—each specifying explicit domain weightings, per-domain tolerance thresholds, and global suppression and abstention biases. Profiles are immutable data structures with no embedded logic, intended to be consumed by higher-level orchestration components. This establishes a clear separation between evaluative posture selection and downstream control mechanisms, enabling predictable mode behavior without hidden heuristics or “magic” switches.

In parallel, the constraint and safety integration layer was scaffolded to enforce strict dominance of safety signals over reward modulation. A formal constraint hook interface was introduced to define the contract for hard constraints, alongside a reward–safety bridge responsible for veto, rollback, and last-verified-state reversion semantics. This layer operates independently of domain evaluation and synthesis, ensuring that reward signals remain advisory and cannot override constraint outcomes. At this stage, the implementation focuses on structural guarantees and enforcement pathways rather than concrete constraint logic.

Finally, a set of evaluation hooks was implemented to support quantitative, post-hoc assessment of system behavior. These collectors compute metrics including constraint violation rate, scenario consistency, hallucination incidence, abstention rate, self-correction delta, latency impact, and provenance completeness. All metrics are stateless, side-effect-free, and designed for aggregation and audit rather than control. Numerical outputs are stabilized for reproducibility where appropriate, reflecting their intended use in institutional review and long-horizon monitoring rather than real-time decision-making.

Throughout this phase, testing focused on contract enforcement, numerical stability, and deterministic behavior. Errors encountered during integration were limited to symbol consistency and floating-point precision issues, both of which were resolved without altering architectural intent. No changes were made to generation pathways, memory systems, or adaptive learning components.

At the conclusion of this phase, the system gained a stable, mode-aware configuration layer, an explicit safety dominance scaffold, and a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics suitable for logging and institutional review. Subsequent work will focus on feedback and logging infrastructure and on wiring these components into higher-level orchestration layers, which are intentionally not exposed at this stage.
