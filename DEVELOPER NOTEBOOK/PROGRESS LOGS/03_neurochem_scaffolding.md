Development log: Phase 10 – Neurochemical substrate, dopamine SDE dynamics, and simulation scaffolding
Date: 12 January 2026

This phase initiated the implementation of the neurochemical layer responsible for simulating neuromodulator dynamics, with a particular focus on dopamine. The goal was to establish a physiologically grounded and extensible substrate capable of supporting both real-time and offline simulation of neurochemical state evolution, suitable for integration into reward modeling, behavioral modulation, and cognitive inference pathways in future phases.

A modular dopamine system was implemented as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model incorporating novelty-sensitive release, reward prediction error modulation, fatigue-tracked reuptake, and vesicular noise. Parameter modulation pathways were integrated to support oscillation-driven neuromodulation via spectral input channels (e.g., gamma, theta), allowing for dynamic, frequency-aware tuning of dopaminergic kinetics. The system is structured to support future receptor-specific extensions without requiring architectural changes.

Complementing the biochemical model, a deterministic simulation engine was constructed to coordinate signal propagation and state updates across a defined time horizon. This engine accepts externally supplied novelty, RPE, and oscillation functions as time-varying inputs and tracks concentration and fatigue over each timestep using Euler–Maruyama integration. Internal state history is retained for downstream analysis, visualization, or meta-model supervision.

Test scaffolding was built for the dopamine module using synthetic input cases to verify stability under high novelty, edge-case fatigue, and oscillatory parameter shifts. All tests passed deterministically across seeds. Parameter mutation via oscillatory modulation was verified to produce expected deviations in concentration trajectories without destabilizing the simulation or inducing boundary violations.

Earlier errors related to module imports and test collection failures were traced to accidental deletion of the domain reward structure and were subsequently resolved through reconstruction of the affected directory tree and submodule re-registration. No logic regressions were introduced during the recovery process.

This phase concludes with a validated dopamine module, a functional neurochemical simulation engine, and a testing framework ready for expansion. The system is now positioned to accept additional transmitters (e.g., serotonin, acetylcholine) and to support multi-transmitter interactions, receptor-specific kinetics, and cross-signal coupling. Future work will focus on receptor binding profiles, neuromodulator integration policy, and temporal coordination with reward synthesis layers.
