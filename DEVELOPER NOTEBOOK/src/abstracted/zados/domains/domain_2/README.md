Note on Scope and Disclosure

This repository functions as a developer notebook documenting active design and implementation of ZA-DOS. It emphasizes system structure, interface boundaries, and architectural decisions rather than complete or polished internals.

Some components are intentionally hidden or redacted. This is a deliberate engineering choice: several subsystems are still evolving, and publishing partial implementations would either misrepresent stability or prematurely lock interfaces. The focus here is on making the system legible while under construction, without oversharing internals that are still in flux.
