# Zonal-Adaptive-Dynamics-Operating-System-ZADOS-

ZA-DOS (Zonal Adaptive Dynamics Operating System) is an experimental cognitive architecture designed to explore non-trivial intelligence beyond model-centric or purely predictive approaches. It treats intelligence as a layered, dynamic process composed of reward modulation, internal state regulation, memory systems, and orchestration logic: a modular cognitive operating system for adaptive intelligence, governance, and controlled decision-making under uncertainty.

Rather than relying on a single reasoning mechanism, the architecture supports multiple cognitive engines and analytical modules, which can be composed, simulated, and governed within a unified framework.

Large language models are used strictly as an interpretive interface for human-readable interaction, not as the core decision-making substrate. The architecture is intended to support simulation, governance, and intervention testing as capabilities, rather than defining intelligence as forecasting or optimization alone.

ZA-DOS is a research and prototyping framework for studying adaptive cognition, system-level intelligence, and governance under uncertainty, with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and explicit control over cognitive dynamics.
